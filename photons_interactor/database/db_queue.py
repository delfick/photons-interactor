"""
A connector between a bunch of database connections in threads
and the asyncio event loop.

Usage is as follows:

    def some_action(db):
        # db is an instance of photons_interactor.database.connection.DatabaseConnection
        entry = db.create_entry(...)
        db.add(entry)
    await db_queue.request(some_action)

By requesting the function you are putting it onto a queue that will be
picked up by another thread. That thread will then create a database session
that is passed into the function.

The `request` function returns a future that is eventually fulfilled by that
worker and that's how we get the result from the different thread back into the
event loop.
